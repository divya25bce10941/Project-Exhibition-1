# Multi-Vehicle Speed Detection System

A complete, standalone **Multi-Vehicle Speed Detection System** in Python using **YOLOv8** object detection and a custom **Centroid Tracker** built from scratch.

This system detects multiple vehicles (Cars, Motorcycles, Buses, Trucks) in real-time from a fixed CCTV traffic video stream, tracks them across frames with persistent IDs, measures the precise frame time taken to travel between two virtual reference lines, and calculates speed in **km/h**.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **YOLOv8 Object Detection**: Pre-trained model (`yolov8n.pt`) automatically detects vehicle classes (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`).
- **Custom Centroid Tracker**: Built from scratch using Euclidean distance matching without external tracking libraries.
- **Two-Line Virtual Speed Trap**:
  - Entry Line (Yellow) records start time.
  - Exit Line (Red) records stop time.
  - Speed formula: $\text{Speed (km/h)} = \frac{\text{Distance (m)}}{\Delta t \text{ (s)}} \times 3.6$.
- **Real-Time HUD Overlay**:
  - Semi-transparent stats dashboard (vehicles tracked, in zone, average/max speed, FPS).
  - Vehicle classification breakdown bar.
  - Motion trail tails behind tracked vehicles.
  - Over-speed alert highlighting (Red bounding box & ⚠️ indicator).
- **Automated Overspeed Snapshot**: Saves high-speed vehicle crops directly to `output/overspeeding/`.
- **CSV Speed Logging**: Automatic event logging with timestamps to `logs/speed_log_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`.
- **Speed Histogram Generator**: Saves a matplotlib speed distribution graph (`output/speed_histogram.png`) upon completion.
- **Exhibition Live Controls**: Adjust line positions live during playback using keys `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`.

### Basic Usage:
Place a sample traffic video in the `videos/` folder and run:
```bash
python3 speed_detector.py --video videos/sample_traffic.mp4
```

### Custom Settings:
```bash
python3 speed_detector.py --video videos/sample_traffic.mp4 --distance 15.0 --speed-limit 50 --output output/result_demo.mp4
```

## 📐 Calibration Guide for Exhibition

1. **Identify Road References**: Find two distinct road points (e.g. lane divider segments or poles) visible in your video. In India, standard dashed lane markings are ~3.0m with ~4.5m gaps (7.5m cycle).
2. **Estimate Distance**: Count how many markings span between Line 1 and Line 2, and pass `--distance <meters>`.
3. **Live Fine-Tuning**: Use keys `1/2` and `3/4` while the video plays to position the virtual lines perpendicular to traffic flow.
